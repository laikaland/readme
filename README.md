laika ðŸª¼ she/they ðŸª¼ minor (15) 

mutuals can call me moldy

---------------------------------------

sharing selfshipper, noodle (gorillaz) and tree (bfdi) are my f/os

hyperfixating on gorillaz and the magnus archives at the moment

i like object shows, analog horror, crk, pokemon, natm, madoka magica, & lots of other stuff. i have a big list in my strawpage

---------------------------------------

for ponytown: c+h always, dnc, inspiration is fine, just don't take too much. boops are okay & kisses are okay just dont make it weird

byi: im quite shy so i'm often pretty scared to int. usually i prefer you int first but i'll int first sometimes.. im open to making friends plz be my friend

i'm not good at social interaction at ALL im so sorry sjdjdks 

if we're friends i might yap about my interests and what i'm hyperfixated on and what i'm happy about. i just need an outlet sometimes

don't make sexual jokes around me unless we're friends.. light jokes are fine just dont get too freaky yknow

im christian but i wont talk about my faith like at all. it's pretty personal to me and i prefer not to talk about it unless i'm directly asked. so if you're uncomfy w christianity i definitley won't talk about it either

im not very talkative, especially around new people. if there's not someone else keeping up the conversation i may loose interest and leave. sorry!

tonetags preffered!!!

dni: basic dni, pro/com/darkship, anti furry, anti therian, anti yume/selfship (verryy heavy dni i will block you sorry not sorry. /srs) 

will block if u make me uncomfortable. i block freely. 

thin ice: (basically: you can interact, just don't talk about these topics around me.) hh/hb, satanists (you can talk about it lightly w me but dont talk about it heavily)

very picky when it comes to gorillaz fans. i don't like ships that much. me befriending you depends on your interpretations of dynamics between the members and your characterization of the members. i dont like murdad/noodle just seeing any of the members as a parent figure . sorry those guys did not take good care of noodle at all ESPECIALLY murdoc

if you infantilize 2d/noodle/really anyone (i guess but i mostly see it with those two) DNI
